This is the simplest gpx file which will import successfully as a waypoint:

<gpx>
<wpt lat="42" lon="-71">
<name>Test</name>
</wpt>
</gpx>


This is the simplest gpx file which will import successfully as a geocache:

<gpx>
<wpt lat="42" lon="-71">
<name>GC1234</name>
<Groundspeak:cache id="1">
<Groundspeak:name>Test</Groundspeak:name>
</Groundspeak:cache>
</wpt>
</gpx>


The Colorado needs to see a groundspeak cache tag and requires a unique integer id for each cache. 
It also needs a groundspeak name, removing the groundspeak name tag results in neither a waypoint or cache being created.
